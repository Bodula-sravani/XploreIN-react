        "The Sundarbans in West Bengal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that's notable for being the largest mangrove jungle in the world. About 35% of the Sundarbans lies in India, and this part of it is made up of 102 islands, just over half of which are inhabited. Village life there is challenging. There's no mains water supply, electricity, roads, or cars. People live in homes built from mud and straw, and are constantly wary of attack from tigers. Tora Eco Resort on Bali Island is a unique community-operated tourism project, with six ethnic cottages surrounded by paddy fields. Guests can go on village walks and participate in village activities, as well as explore the narrow canals of the Sundarbans by country boat (similar to a large canoe).",

        "Boutique Chandoori Sai Guesthouse in Goudaguda pottery village, in Odisha's far south Koraput district, is a remarkable labor of love for its Australia owner, Leon. He conceptualized and built the guesthouse himself with the help of the local potters whom he recruited to make the terracotta floor tiles, roof tiles, and ornamental urns. Many of the tribal village women are also employed to help run the property. Guests can explore the village at leisure, visit the potters' colony (firing in the traditional-style kiln takes place on weekends) and learn pottery, go on nature walks in the surrounding hills, spend time with the tribal women (they will sing and dance beautifully if asked), watch food being prepared and learn some cooking tips. A local guide from the village leads village-to-village hikes, and there are many fascinating tribal markets held in the area. You can even walk with the village women to the market!",
